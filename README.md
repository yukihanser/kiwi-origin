There are two files for paper "A new analysis of kiwifruit quality grading based on image multi-feature fusion and ResTNet model"
1, File Comment.xlsx shows 9 comments for every kiwi photo we took. Based on manual evaluation, we developed and established three grading standards (A, B, and C), which were applied in the paper.
2, File kiwi-origin shows presents all original kiwifruit image data we collected for developing grading evaluation standards and subsequently building the model.
